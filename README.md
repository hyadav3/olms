Online Library Management System
Our project is an online library management system that simplifies the process of managing books in a library. The system allows administrators to add new books to the library and view the available books. Additionally, administrators can delete books from the library if needed. The system makes use of a pre-existing books.csv dataset from Kaggle or manual addition of books by administrators.
