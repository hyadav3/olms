# Online Library Management System

This project aim is to create a website that will help faculty members at university to manage existing books efficiently. The problem that this project aiming to solve is the difficulty that faculty members face in managing library books. This can be due to various reasons such as having a large number of books to manage, difficulty in keeping track of book availability, and time-consuming processes to add or remove books in their websites. Thus, this website will provide an intuitive platform for faculty members to manage their books. Members can easily add new books to their library, view available books, and update or remove books that are no longer required.
